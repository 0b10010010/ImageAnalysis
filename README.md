# KSU SUAS Image Analysis GUI

When it opens, click on Load Image button. Use right mouse button to drag an area you want to crop, but right now it does not know the origin of the right mouse click relative to the zoomed in image. Clicking on the Crop button will save an image.

Current issue: QRubberBand origin does not know the position relative to the zoomed in image.
